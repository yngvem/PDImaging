## A Python toolkit for variational and PDE based image processing
PDE based image processing is an important part of image processing, however, there are no proper Python toolboxes for these methods. This package is an attempt to fill that hole.

## Current project state
This is a project is written as a project on the side of my studies and are only a couple of weeks old, and therefore not anywhere near any state of completion. There only functions currently implemented are for improving image quality, denoising using Perona Malik iterations and ROF/TV-L2 denoising as well as TV-L2 regularised deconvolution.

### Immediate todo list:
1. Better understanding of distutils, so that I won't need more than one setupfile.
2. Structure header files in own folder.
3. TVL1 deconvolution.
4. Improve deconvolution framework.
5. Start on segmentation algorithms.

## About me
I am a graduate student, studying biophysics and image processing at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, with goals of writing a PhD within one of those fields. I can be reached by e-mail at yngve.m.moe@gmail.com.
